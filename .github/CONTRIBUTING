Contributing
============
Welcome to XIV_Databar Continued, I thank you in advance for your contributions.

I want to report a bug
----------------------
* Look at the [open and closed issues](https://github.com/ZelionGG/XIV_Databar-Continued/issues?q=is%3Aissue) to see if this was not already discussed before. If you can't see any, feel free to [open a new issue](https://github.com/ZelionGG/XIV_Databar-Continued/issues/new).

I want to contribute to the code
--------------------------------
* Make sure to discuss your ideas with the community in an [issue](https://github.com/ZelionGG/XIV_Databar-Continued/issues).
* Take a look at the open issues labeled as [`help wanted`](https://github.com/ZelionGG/XIV_Databar-Continued/labels/help%20wanted) if you want to help without having a specific idea in mind.
* Make sure that your PRs do not contain unnecessary commits or merge commits. [Squash commits](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History) whenever possible.
* [Rebase](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing) (instead of merge) outdated PRs on the `master` branch.
