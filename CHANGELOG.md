## Retail Era

## Classic Era

#### Fixes :

- Micromenu module _(buttons are now working as expected and social tooltips are fixed)_
- Tradeskill module _(progress bar, click to open, tooltips, ...)_
- Gold module _(golds, bag opener, bags empty spaces, ...)_
- Armor module _(durability percentages are now correctly displayed)_
- Currency module _(will show you your 3 tracked currencies in the bar or your experience bar if enabled)_
- Talents module _(as of now, it's only a static information, you can't change into your second spec with the module)_

- Clock module _(left click to open the calendar, right click to open the timer feature)_
